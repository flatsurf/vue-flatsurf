vue-flatsurf Change Log
=======================

.. current developments

v0.4.0
====================

**Added:**

* Deploy a demo application automatically to https://flatsurf.github.io/vue-flatsurf/app

**Fixed:**

* Fix some gluings of inner edges.
  Before, when two cells glued along two edges simultaneously, only one of them
  was glued and the other one showed as an edge, -edge pair as if it was not an
  inner edge.



v0.3.0
====================

**Fixed:**

* Do not show "inner structure" of minimal components.
  Usually, when libflatsurf produces a minimal component, it is already very
  stretched out in flow direction due to all the steps of Rauzy induction that
  happened. This internal structure has no meaning and should not be shown to
  the user. We are only interested in the boundaries of the minimal component
  here.
* Better spacing when packing components.
  We now try to guess the eventual screen size when packing components that cannot be glued visually.



v0.2.0
====================

**Added:**

* Expose layout and inner half edges through events in SurfaceViewer.

**Fixed:**

* Fixed forcing logic of glued half edges, i.e., clicking in half edges in ipyvue-flatsurf works again.



v0.1.0
====================
