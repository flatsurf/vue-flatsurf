vue-flatsurf Change Log
=======================

.. current developments

v0.7.1
====================



v0.7.0
====================

**Added:**

* Support rotated coordinate systems in the input so we can always make cylinders vertical or horizontal.

**Fixed:**

* Make sure that vertical cylinder perimeters are completely labeled.
* Drop dependency on assert which does not work in some browsers.



v0.6.0
====================

**Added:**

* Identify Delaunay cells through provided automorphisms, i.e., force
  identified half edges to be all visually glued or all visually unglued. Also
  only show one copy of every Delaunay cell.
* Show vertex indicators when half edges meet at (almost) collinear directions.

**Changed:**

* Only display flow component boundary when the surface is hovered. Before,
  cylinders looked slightly too small in static pictures.
* Relabeling half edges so that the outer half edges get short identifiers. The
  original half edge number is now only shown when hovering over the edge.

**Fixed:**

* Fixed spacing of unglued components. Increased the spacing by 5px so that the
  outer border of a triangulation is accounted for.



v0.5.2
====================

**Fixed:**

* Half edges are now clickable on the half edge labels.
* Remove opacity from flow components and pick better colors to get a light effect.
* Remove artifacts in flow components.



v0.5.1
====================

**Fixed:**

* make exported SVGs work with inkscape; before the SVG used some features that inkscape does not support yet, such as `rgba()`.



v0.5.0
====================

**Added:**

* `Surface.vue` and `SurfaceViewer.vue` now emit a `svg` event with a
  standalone SVG when the layout changes. This can be used to export to an SVG
  file.

**Fixed:**

* Refactored layouting so it is injected into the component displaying a triangulation in a more standard way.
* Fixed "loading..." overlay in the demo application.



v0.4.0
====================

**Added:**

* Deploy a demo application automatically to https://flatsurf.github.io/vue-flatsurf/app

**Fixed:**

* Fix some gluings of inner edges.
  Before, when two cells glued along two edges simultaneously, only one of them
  was glued and the other one showed as an edge, -edge pair as if it was not an
  inner edge.



v0.3.0
====================

**Fixed:**

* Do not show "inner structure" of minimal components.
  Usually, when libflatsurf produces a minimal component, it is already very
  stretched out in flow direction due to all the steps of Rauzy induction that
  happened. This internal structure has no meaning and should not be shown to
  the user. We are only interested in the boundaries of the minimal component
  here.
* Better spacing when packing components.
  We now try to guess the eventual screen size when packing components that cannot be glued visually.



v0.2.0
====================

**Added:**

* Expose layout and inner half edges through events in SurfaceViewer.

**Fixed:**

* Fixed forcing logic of glued half edges, i.e., clicking in half edges in ipyvue-flatsurf works again.



v0.1.0
