vue-flatsurf Change Log
=======================

.. current developments

v0.10.1
====================

**Added:**

* Added a `build:es:dev` target to rebuild more conveniently when developing
  inside Jupyter(Lab)

**Fixed:**

* Fixed loading of widget in JupyterLab.



v0.10.0
====================

**Fixed:**

* Implemented layouting of disconnected surfaces that are typically created when collapsing cylinders in a surface.



v0.9.1
====================

**Fixed:**

* Allow library to be built in development mode and demo app to be built in production mode.
* Do not cache `PathInteraction` in computed property. Otherwise, it is only
  possible to draw a path once in the widget.



v0.9.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added a callback to request the currently drawn path as `Widget.path()`.

* Added an animation to make it easier to understand the currently drawn path.

* Added `saddle-connections` and `paths` on `Widget` and `Flatsurf` component
  to display paths and saddle connections.

**Fixed:**

* Made `Layouter` work without an explicit `run` injected from the outside.
* Show inner edges in demo app initially. Otherwise, it is unclear how gluing is performed.
* Wait for Viewer to be ready before attempting to export SVG in `Widget.svg()`.



v0.8.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added `PathInteraction` and `GlueInteraction` to fill a slot in the
  `Viewer.vue`. This allows any interaction with the surface to pulled out into
  a separate component.

* Added `Edge.vue` so we do not need special handling when pairs of `HalfEdge` are in the same location.

* When visually gluing half edges, the glued half edge is now kept in place
  visually which should make it easier to understand how the gluing was
  performed.

* Added `Layouter` component to optionally take care of layouting.

* Added `Widget` component which encapsulates all the features that are exposed by ipyvue-flatsurf.

**Changed:**

* Renamed `SurfaceViewer.vue` to `Viewer.vue`.

* Moved `HalfEdge.vue`, `FlatTriangulation.vue`, `Face.vue`, `FlowComponent.vue`, `SaddleConnection.vue` to `components/flatsurf`.

* Renamed `focus` of `PanZoom.vue` to `value` to make it `v-model` bindable.

* Moved aspects of visualization such as indicators to `VisualizationOptions`.

* Moved aspects of layouting to `LayoutOptions`.

* Renamed `FlatTriangulationLayout` to `Layout`.

**Removed:**

* Removed `ExtendedClickArea.vue`. Instead interactions should be explicit about event handling now.

* Removed unused `IParsed` interface.

**Fixed:**

* The focused area of `PanZoom.vue` is now two-way bindable with `v-model`.

* The SVG output now resizes when its container resizes.

* Coordinate systems can now have more than one embedding established with `embedInto()`.



v0.7.3
====================

**Fixed:**

* Bring back accidentally deleted call to ensure caches when rendering flow components.

* Link to latest released version on zenodo in README.



v0.7.2
====================

**Fixed:**

* Relayout surface when surface data or automorphism data changes. (Fixes a
  problem in the demo application which did not correctly update when changing
  the yaml surface data.)



v0.7.1
====================



v0.7.0
====================

**Added:**

* Support rotated coordinate systems in the input so we can always make cylinders vertical or horizontal.

**Fixed:**

* Make sure that vertical cylinder perimeters are completely labeled.
* Drop dependency on assert which does not work in some browsers.



v0.6.0
====================

**Added:**

* Identify Delaunay cells through provided automorphisms, i.e., force
  identified half edges to be all visually glued or all visually unglued. Also
  only show one copy of every Delaunay cell.
* Show vertex indicators when half edges meet at (almost) collinear directions.

**Changed:**

* Only display flow component boundary when the surface is hovered. Before,
  cylinders looked slightly too small in static pictures.
* Relabeling half edges so that the outer half edges get short identifiers. The
  original half edge number is now only shown when hovering over the edge.

**Fixed:**

* Fixed spacing of unglued components. Increased the spacing by 5px so that the
  outer border of a triangulation is accounted for.



v0.5.2
====================

**Fixed:**

* Half edges are now clickable on the half edge labels.
* Remove opacity from flow components and pick better colors to get a light effect.
* Remove artifacts in flow components.



v0.5.1
====================

**Fixed:**

* make exported SVGs work with inkscape; before the SVG used some features that inkscape does not support yet, such as `rgba()`.



v0.5.0
====================

**Added:**

* `Surface.vue` and `SurfaceViewer.vue` now emit a `svg` event with a
  standalone SVG when the layout changes. This can be used to export to an SVG
  file.

**Fixed:**

* Refactored layouting so it is injected into the component displaying a triangulation in a more standard way.
* Fixed "loading..." overlay in the demo application.



v0.4.0
====================

**Added:**

* Deploy a demo application automatically to https://flatsurf.github.io/vue-flatsurf/app

**Fixed:**

* Fix some gluings of inner edges.
  Before, when two cells glued along two edges simultaneously, only one of them
  was glued and the other one showed as an edge, -edge pair as if it was not an
  inner edge.



v0.3.0
====================

**Fixed:**

* Do not show "inner structure" of minimal components.
  Usually, when libflatsurf produces a minimal component, it is already very
  stretched out in flow direction due to all the steps of Rauzy induction that
  happened. This internal structure has no meaning and should not be shown to
  the user. We are only interested in the boundaries of the minimal component
  here.
* Better spacing when packing components.
  We now try to guess the eventual screen size when packing components that cannot be glued visually.



v0.2.0
====================

**Added:**

* Expose layout and inner half edges through events in SurfaceViewer.

**Fixed:**

* Fixed forcing logic of glued half edges, i.e., clicking in half edges in ipyvue-flatsurf works again.



v0.1.0
====================
