vue-flatsurf Change Log
=======================

.. current developments

v0.3.0
====================

**Fixed:**

* Do not show "inner structure" of minimal components.
  Usually, when libflatsurf produces a minimal component, it is already very
  stretched out in flow direction due to all the steps of Rauzy induction that
  happened. This internal structure has no meaning and should not be shown to
  the user. We are only interested in the boundaries of the minimal component
  here.
* Better spacing when packing components.
  We now try to guess the eventual screen size when packing components that cannot be glued visually.



v0.2.0
====================

**Added:**

* Expose layout and inner half edges through events in SurfaceViewer.

**Fixed:**

* Fixed forcing logic of glued half edges, i.e., clicking in half edges in ipyvue-flatsurf works again.



v0.1.0
====================
